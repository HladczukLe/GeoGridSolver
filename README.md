# GeoGridSolver
[GeoGrid](https://www.geogridgame.com/) is a daily trivia game made to put your geography knowledge to the test!

### How to Play
Guess a country for each box in the board that matches the criteria specified by the box's row and column categories.

Each box on any given board has anywhere from 5 to 30 unique answers.

### Rules
Players have 10 guesses to fill out the grid, but can enable infinite mode for unlimited.

A country can only be guessed once per game board.

### Objective
Complete the board by filling all 9 boxes with a country that matches the criteria for the intersection of categories.

Finish with the lowest score possible.

### Scoring
The score is calculated by the sum of the rarities of each box on the board.

Empty cells are scored as 100.

The rarer the guess, the lower the score.

The lower the score, the better.
